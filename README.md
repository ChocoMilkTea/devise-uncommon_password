# Devise Uncommon Password
devise-uncommon_password is an extension for the devise gem, which prevents users from signing up using one of the 100 most common passwords. Currently, the list of common passwords is derived from the list at  http://www.whatsmypass.com/the-top-500-worst-passwords-of-all-time. As devise already rejects passwords less than 8 characters in length, I removed all such passwords from the list, and then selected the top 100 from the remaining passwords.

## Usage
How to use my plugin.

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'devise-uncommon_password'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle install
```

Then add the :uncommon_password module to your model:
```
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable,
       :recoverable, :rememberable, :trackable, :validatable, :uncommon_password
end
```

And you're ready to go.
